# 🧠 K-Means Clustering on Mall Customers

## 📌 Objective
Apply **unsupervised learning** using **K-Means Clustering** to segment mall customers based on their **annual income** and **spending score**.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Name:** `Mall_Customers.csv`
- Contains customer demographics like Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Libraries: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`, `Seaborn`

## ✅ Steps Performed
1. **Load and explore the dataset**
2. **Select relevant features** (Annual Income, Spending Score)
3. **Visualize raw data**
4. **Apply Elbow Method** to find optimal number of clusters
5. **Fit K-Means model** and assign cluster labels
6. **Visualize clusters** with centroids
7. **Evaluate clustering** using **Silhouette Score**

## 📊 Output
- Clear segmentation of customers into clusters
- Visual plots of customer groups and centroids
- Silhouette Score indicating clustering performance

## 📁 Files Included
- `KMeans_Mall_Customers.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with complete implementation
- `Mall_Customers.csv` – Customer data used for clustering
